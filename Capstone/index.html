            <h3><b>Abstract</b></h3>
            <p>Tacoma link rail (Line T) has served hundreds of thousands commuters and students since 2003 and by serving it, it has brought positive impacts to the downtown of Tacoma. In fact, many studies have found the significant impacts that the link rail can bring. However, the limited service of Line T from Tacoma dome to Downtown Tacoma has limited the use of passengers and often segregate people from other areas that do not have light rail. It is time to bring those positive impacts to other areas of the city and make a better environment and economy by extending Line T to other areas of the city. Thus, this research paper aims to determine where the ideal areas for extending Line T can be. In other words, in what areas, would the extension be able to bring the most effects of the link rail?
            </p>

            <p>To approach the problem, the comparative impact model is built based on case studies with the criteria that need to be considered. The criteria include socio-economic status, traffic congestion, air quality, and demography. Through the comparative model and the criteria, I evaluate the impacts in changes before and after light rail opening and be able to compare between cities with Tacoma. The result indicates that Tacoma has experienced significant effects from light rail since its opening and the future plan for the extension should be towards South Tacoma as it is projected to have the most effects in the area. Building on this, I suggest that further studies should be conducted that goes beyond the city of Tacoma.
